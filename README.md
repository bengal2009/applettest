applettest
==========

This project is an example which shows how to embed a Java applet in modern
browsers.  It uses the embed tag which is now part of HTML 5 but still uses
the object tag for IE because of the automatic install of the Java Runtime.

Features demonstrated in this project:

* How to embed a Java Applet for all major browsers.
* How to pass arguments to the applet (param tag for object and
  attributes for embed)
* How to call JavaScript functions from the Java Applet.
* How to call Java methods from JavaScript.
